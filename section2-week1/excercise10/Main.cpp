/*Exercise 10 - Anything but Lowercase Vowel
Rewrite the previous exercise but this time check that the given character is NOT a lowercase vowel. Use the same conditions you used previously and only change the relational operators. You are not allowed to use a negation operator to wrap the whole set of conditions.
Hint: You might want to look up DeMorganâ€™s Law for this one.
