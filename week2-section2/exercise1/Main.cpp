/*
* Exercise 1 - Songs
Create a Song class in your project. Make sure to declare it in a .h and define it in a .cpp.

Your Song class should have the following private members:
std::string songTitle;
std::string artistName;
int duration;

It should have a default constructor, a constructor with parameters to initialize the private members, getters, and setters.

Additionally, implement the following methods:
std::string getFormatedDuration(); // Should return duration in the mm:ss format
bool isValid(); // You decide how a song is considered valid or not
